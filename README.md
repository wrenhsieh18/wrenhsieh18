* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jenhsiang Hsieh, and often go by Wren.
*  :muscle: I am currently a data enginner with AT&T and working on ETL pipeline building using PySpark and SQL, managing large scale datasets.
* ðŸŒ± Before AT&T, I learned Full-stack Web Development through LaunchCode LC101 and LiftOff programs. The programs include JavaScript, Java, MySQL, SpringBoot, Angular JS and Thymeleaf.
* ðŸš€ I built a full-stack web application during my learning in LaunchCode. It is a Pet organizer app based on SpringBoot, Java and Thymeleaf. Please visit the pet-life repo to take a look my work.
